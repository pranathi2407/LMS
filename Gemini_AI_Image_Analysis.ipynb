I choose a few versatile protein and vegetable combinations (chicken and broccoli are a winner!), prepare them in bulk on a Sunday, and portion them out into these handy containers *  This system helps me avoid those \"I'm too tired to cook\" moments, ensures I'm eating nutritious meals, and saves me a ton of time during the week *\n> \n> The best part?  Knowing I have healthy, delicious meals ready to go eliminates the stress of daily food decisions, leaving me feeling more energized and focused *  It might seem daunting at first, but even a little meal prep makes a big difference * So, ditch the takeout menus and embrace the calm of a prepped fridge *  Your future self will thank you!\n"
